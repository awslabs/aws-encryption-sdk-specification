## Definitions

### Conventions used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Overview

This document includes the specifications for common structures referenced throughout the
AWS Encryption SDK specification.
These structures define a group of related fields that MUST hold certain properties.
Wherever these structures are referenced in this specification,
implementations MUST ensure that all properties of a structure's fields are upheld.

Note that this specification does not specify how these structures should be represented or passed
throughout the AWS Encryption SDK framework.
While these structures will usually be represented as objects, lower level languages MAY represent
these fields in a less strictly defined way as long as all field properties are still upheld.

Structures defined in this document:

- [Encrypted Data Key](#encrypted-data-key)
- [Encryption Context](#encryption-context)
- [Encryption Materials](#encryption-materials)
- [Decryption Materials](#decryption-materials)

### Encrypted Data Key

#### Implementations

- [C](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-c/blob/master/include/aws/cryptosdk/edk.h)
- [Javascript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-javascript/blob/master/modules/material-management/src/encrypted_data_key.ts)
- [Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/blob/master/src/aws_encryption_sdk/structures.py)
- [Java](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/encryptionsdk/EncryptedDataKey.java)

#### Structure

An encrypted data key is comprised of the following fields:

- [Key Provider ID](#key-provider-id)
- [Key Provider Information](#key-provider-information)
- [Ciphertext](#ciphertext)

Note: "Encrypted" is a misnomer here, as the process by which a key provider may obtain the plaintext data key
from the ciphertext and vice versa does not have to be an encryption and decryption cipher.
This specification uses the terms "encrypt" and "decrypt" for simplicity,
but the actual process by which a key provider obtains the plaintext data key from the ciphertext
and vice versa MAY be any reversible operation, though we expect that most will use encryption.

##### Key Provider ID

The [key provider ID](keyring-interface.md#key-provider-id) value
for the keyring that wrote this encrypted data key.

##### Key Provider Information

The [key provider info](keyring-interface.md#key-provider-info) value
for the keyring that wrote this encrypted data key.

##### Ciphertext

An opaque value from which an appropriate key provider can obtain the plaintext data key.

Some key provider MUST be capable of deterministically obtaining the plaintext key from the ciphertext.

Most commonly this is an encrypted form of the plaintext data key.
Alternatively, it could be the public input to a KDF that derives the plaintext data key or
an identifier into a key store that will return the plaintext data key.

### Encryption Context

#### Implementations

- [C](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-c/blob/master/include/aws/cryptosdk/enc_ctx.h)
- [Javascript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-javascript/blob/master/modules/material-management/src/types.ts)
- [Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/blob/master/src/aws_encryption_sdk/internal/formatting/encryption_context.py)
- [Java](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/encryptionsdk/internal/EncryptionContextSerializer.java)

#### Structure

The encryption context is a key-value mapping of arbitrary, non-secret, UTF-8 encoded strings.
It is used during [encryption](../client-apis/encrypt.md) and [decryption](../client-apis/decrypt.md) to provide additional authenticated data (AAD).

Users SHOULD use the encryption context to store:

- Non-secret data that MUST remain associated with the [message](../data-format/message.md) ciphertext.
- Data that is useful in logging and tracking, such as data about the file type, purpose, or ownership.

Users MUST NOT use the encryption context to store secret data.
