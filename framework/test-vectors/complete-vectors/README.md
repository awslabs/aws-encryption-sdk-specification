## Summary

For each type of key description,
there is a file that describes how this component is tested.
This simplifies reasoning about each component.
To find out how the DefaultCMM is tested
look at the default-cmm.md file
that describes how this competent is tested
and the various features can be reasoned about.

The test vectors MUST compose all these individual tests together
into larger manifest files.

## Motivation

By keeping every component separate is is easier to find
and reason about the completeness of testing.
