# Raw RSA Keyring Vectors

## Version

1.0.0

## Summary

This describes the test cases for the [Raw RSA Keyring](../../raw-rsa-keyring.md)

## Reference-level Explanation

## Definitions

- positive key description: a [key description](../key-description.md) that when parsed and generated can produce
  valid encryption and decryption materials.

### Basic tests

A positive key descriptions for every [supported padding scheme](../../raw-rsa-keyring.md#supported-padding-schemes) MUST be generated.
The provider-id for each padding scheme MUST be different.
A test MUST attempt to encrypt and decrypt
with every available [algorithm suite](../../algorithm-suites.md#algorithm-suite-id)
A test MUST attempt every [standard encryption context](./encryption-context.md#standard-encryption-contexts).
