# ESDK Test Vector Enumeration 

This document performs the [test vector enumeration](test-vector-enumeration.md) process for the ESDK
to construct the full suite of test vectors
for the ESDK.

The full suite of test vectors can be constructed
by [enumerating all input configurations](test-vector-enumeration.md#enumerating-input-configurations) from this spec's input dimensions
and [evaluating each configuration's expected result](test-vector-enumeration.md#determining-expected-results) from this spec's evaluation rules.

## Input dimensions

* Every [MPL input dimension](mpl-test-vector-enumeration.md#input-dimensions) is an input dimension for ESDK.

## Evaluation rules

* Every [MPL evaluation rule](mpl-test-vector-enumeration.md#evaluation-rules) is an evaluation rule for ESDK.
