## Overview

A Keystore persists hierarchical data that allows customers to call AWS KMS less often.
The Keystore persists branch keys in DynamoDb that wrap multiple data keys.
This creates a hierarchy where a branch key wraps multiple data keys and facilitates caching.
These branch keys are only generated using the [AWS KMS API GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext.html).

By creating and persisting a data key to an accesbile medium,
such as a DynamoDb table,
distributed cryptographic agents can use a common, coordinated, cryptographic materials.

This prevents distributed cryptographic agents from independently
generating unique data keys that COULD BE coordinated,
which leads to poor caching performance at decryption,
as each unqiue encrypting agent had a unqiue data key.

This Keystore interface defines operations that any implementation of its specification must support and implement.

## Definitions

- [Branch Key(s)](../structures.md#branch-key): Data keys that are reused to wrap unique data keys for envelope encryption.
  For security considerations on when to rotate the branch key, refer to [Appendix B](aws-kms/aws-kms-hierarchical-keyring.md#appendix-b-security-considerations-for-branch-key-rotation).
- [Beacon Key(s)](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-database-encryption-sdk-dynamodb-java/blob/main/specification/searchable-encryption/beacons.md#beacons):
  A root key used to then derive different beacon keys per beacon.
- [UUID](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt): a universally unique identifier that can be represented as a byte sequence or a string.

### Conventions used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Initialization

The following inputs MAY be specified to create a KeyStore:

- [ID](#keystore-id)
- [AWS KMS Grant Tokens](#aws-kms-grant-tokens)
- [DynamoDb Client](#dynamodb-client)
- [KMS Client](#kms-client)

The following inputs MUST be specified to create a KeyStore:

- [Table Name](#table-name)
- [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration)
- [Logical KeyStore Name](#logical-keystore-name)

### Keystore ID

The Identifier for this KeyStore.
If one is not supplied, then a [version 4 UUID](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) MUST be used.

### AWS KMS Grant Tokens

A list of AWS KMS [grant tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token).

### DynamoDb Client

The DynamoDb Client used to put and get keys from the backing DDB table.

If the AWS KMS Configuration is KMS Key ARN or KMS MRKey ARN,
and no DynamoDb Client is provided,
a new DynamoDb Client MUST be created
with the region of the supplied KMS ARN.

If the AWS KMS Configuration is Discovery,
and no DynamoDb Client is provided,
a new DynamoDb Client MUST be created
with the default configuration.

If the AWS KMS Configuration is MRDiscovery,
and no DynamoDb Client is provided,
a new DynamoDb Client MUST be created
with the region configured in the MRDiscovery.

### KMS Client

The KMS Client used when wrapping and unwrapping keys.

If the AWS KMS Configuration is KMS Key ARN or KMS MRKey ARN,
and no KMS Client is provided,
a new KMS Client MUST be created
with the region of the supplied KMS ARN.

If the AWS KMS Configuration is Discovery,
and no KMS Client is provided,
a new KMS Client MUST be created
with the default configuration.

If the AWS KMS Configuration is MRDiscovery,
and no KMS Client is provided,
a new KMS Client MUST be created
with the region configured in the MRDiscovery.

On initialization the KeyStore SHOULD
append a user agent string to the AWS KMS SDK Client with
the value `aws-kms-hierarchy`.

### Table Name

The table name of the DynamoDb table that backs this Keystore.

### AWS KMS Configuration

This configures the Keystore's KMS Key ARN restrictions,
which determines which KMS Key(s) is used
to wrap and unwrap the keys stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
There are four (4) options:

- Discovery
- MRDiscovery
- Single Region Key Compatibility, denoted as `KMS Key ARN`
- Multi Region Key Compatibility, denoted as `KMS MRKey ARN`

`KMS Key ARN` and `KMS MRKey ARN` MUST take an additional argument
that is a KMS ARN.
This ARN MUST NOT be an Alias.
This ARN MUST be a valid
[AWS KMS Key ARN](./aws-kms/aws-kms-key-arn.md#a-valid-aws-kms-arn).

Both `KMS Key ARN` and `KMS MRKey ARN` accept MRK or regular Single Region KMS ARNs.

To be clear, an KMS ARN for a Multi-Region Key MAY be provided to the `KMS Key ARN` configuration,
and a KMS ARN for non Multi-Region Key MAY be provided to the `KMS MRKey ARN` configuration.

`Discovery` does not take an additional argument.

`MRDiscovery` MUST take an additional argument, which is a region.
Any MRK ARN discovered will be changed to this region before use.

#### AWS Key ARN Compatibility

For two ARNs to be compatible:

If the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) designates single region ARN compatibility,
then two ARNs are compatible if they are exactly equal.

If the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) designates MRK ARN compatibility,
then two ARNs are compatible if they are equal in all parts other than the region.
That is, they are compatible if [AWS KMS MRK Match for Decrypt](aws-kms/aws-kms-mrk-match-for-decrypt.md#implementation) returns true.

If the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) is Discovery or MRDiscovery,
no comparison is ever made between ARNs.

#### Discovery

Discovery takes no additional information.

The Keystore MAY use the KMS Key ARNs already
persisted to the backing DynamoDB table,
provided they are in records created
with an identical Logical Keystore Name.

The `VersionKey` and `CreateKey` Operations are NOT supported
and will fail with a runtime exception.

There is no Multi-Region logic with this configuration;
if a Multi-Region Key is encountered,
and the region in the ARN is not the region of the KMS Client,
requests will fail with KMS Exceptions.

#### MRDiscovery

MRDiscovery takes an additional argument, which is a region.
Any MRK ARN discovered will be changed to this region before use.

The Keystore MAY use the KMS Key ARNs already
persisted to the backing DynamoDB table,
provided they are in records created
with an identical Logical Keystore Name.

The `VersionKey` and `CreateKey` Operations are NOT supported
and will fail with a runtime exception.

### Logical KeyStore Name

This name is cryptographically bound to all data stored in this table,
and logically separates data between different tables.

The logical keystore name MUST be bound to every created key.

There needs to be a one to one mapping between DynamoDB Table Names and the Logical KeyStore Name.
This value can be set to the DynamoDB table name itself, but does not need to.

Controlling this value independently enables restoring from DDB table backups
even when the table name after restoration is not exactly the same.

## Operations

The Keystore MUST support the following operations:

- [GetKeyStoreInfo](#getkeystoreinfo)
- [CreateKeyStore](#createkeystore)
- [CreateKey](#createkey)
- [VersionKey](#versionkey)
- [GetActiveBranchKey](#getactivebranchkey)
- [GetBranchKeyVersion](#getbranchkeyversion)
- [GetBeaconKey](#getbeaconkey)

### GetKeyStoreInfo

This operation MUST return the keystore information in this keystore configuration.

This MUST include:

- [keystore id](#keystore-id)
- [keystore name](#table-name)
- [logical Keystore name](#logical-keystore-name)
- [AWS KMS Grant Tokens](#aws-kms-grant-tokens)
- [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration)

### CreateKeyStore

This operation MUST first calls the DDB::DescribeTable API with the configured `tableName`.

If the response is successful, this operation validates that the table has the expected
[KeySchema](#keyschema) as defined below.
If the [KeySchema](#keyschema) does not match
this operation MUST yield an error.
The table MAY have additional information,
like GlobalSecondaryIndex defined.

If the client responds with a `ResourceNotFoundException`,
then this operation MUST continue and
MUST call [AWS DDB CreateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html)
with the following specifics:

- TableName is the configured tableName.
- [KeySchema](#keyschema) as defined below.

If the operation fails to create table, the operation MUST fail.

If the operation successfully creates a table, the operation MUST return the AWS DDB Table Arn
back to the caller.

#### KeySchema

The following KeySchema MUST be configured on the table:

| AttributeName | KeyType   | Type |
| ------------- | --------- | ---- |
| branch-key-id | Partition | S    |
| type          | Sort      | S    |

### CreateKey

The CreateKey caller MUST provide:

- An optional branch key id
- An optional encryption context

If an optional branch key id is provided
and no encryption context is provided this operation MUST fail.

If the Keystore's KMS Configuration is `Discovery` or `MRDiscovery`,
this operation MUST fail.

If no branch key id is provided,
then this operation MUST create a [version 4 UUID](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)
to be used as the branch key id.

This operation MUST create a [branch key](structures.md#branch-key) and a [beacon key](structures.md#beacon-key) according to
the [Branch Key and Beacon Key Creation](#branch-key-and-beacon-key-creation) section.

If creation of the keys are successful,
the operation MUST call Amazon DynamoDB TransactWriteItems according to the [write key material](#writing-branch-key-and-beacon-key-to-keystore) section.

If writing to the keystore succeeds,
the operation MUST return the branch-key-id that maps to both
the branch key and the beacon key.

Otherwise, this operation MUST yield an error.

#### Branch Key and Beacon Key Creation

To create a branch key, this operation MUST take the following:

- `branchKeyId`: The identifier
- `encryptionContext`: Additional encryption context to bind to the created keys

This operation needs to generate the following:

- `version`: a new guid. This guid MUST be [version 4 UUID](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)
- `timestamp`: a timestamp for the current time.
  This timestamp MUST be in ISO 8601 format in UTC, to microsecond precision (e.g. “YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ssssssZ“)

The wrapped Branch Keys, DECRYPT_ONLY and ACTIVE, MUST be created according to [Wrapped Branch Key Creation](#wrapped-branch-key-creation).

To create a beacon key, this operation will continue to use the `branchKeyId` and `timestamp` as the [Branch Key](structures.md#branch-key).

The operation MUST call [AWS KMS API GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext.html).
The call to AWS KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext MUST use the configured AWS KMS client to make the call.
The operation MUST call AWS KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext with a request constructed as follows:

- `KeyId` MUST be [compatible with](#aws-key-arn-compatibility) the configured KMS Key in the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) for this keystore.
- `NumberOfBytes` MUST be 32.
- `EncryptionContext` MUST be the [encryption context for beacon keys](#beacon-key-encryption-context).
- `GrantTokens` MUST be this keystore's [grant tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token).

If the call to AWS KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext succeeds,
the operation MUST use the `CiphertextBlob` as the wrapped Beacon Key.

#### Wrapped Branch Key Creation

Given a `branchKeyId`, `version` and `timestamp`

The operation MUST call [AWS KMS API GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext.html).
The call to AWS KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext MUST use the configured AWS KMS client to make the call.
The operation MUST call AWS KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext with a request constructed as follows:

- `KeyId` MUST be [compatible with](#aws-key-arn-compatibility) the configured KMS Key in the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) for this keystore.
- `NumberOfBytes` MUST be 32.
- `EncryptionContext` MUST be the [DECRYPT_ONLY encryption context for branch keys](#decrypt_only-encryption-context).
- GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext `GrantTokens` MUST be this keystore's [grant tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token).

If the call to AWS KMS GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext succeeds,
the operation MUST use the GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext result `CiphertextBlob`
as the wrapped DECRYPT_ONLY Branch Key.

The operation MUST call [AWS KMS API ReEncrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ReEncrypt.html)
with a request constructed as follows:

- `SourceEncryptionContext` MUST be the [DECRYPT_ONLY encryption context for branch keys](#decrypt_only-encryption-context).
- `SourceKeyId` MUST be [compatible with](#aws-key-arn-compatibility) the configured KMS Key in the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) for this keystore.
- `CiphertextBlob` MUST be the wrapped DECRYPT_ONLY Branch Key.
- ReEncrypt `GrantTokens` MUST be this keystore's [grant tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token).
- `DestinationKeyId` MUST be [compatible with](#aws-key-arn-compatibility) the configured KMS Key in the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) for this keystore.
- `DestinationEncryptionContext` MUST be the [ACTIVE encryption context for branch keys](#active-encryption-context).

If the call to AWS KMS ReEncrypt succeeds,
the operation MUST use the ReEncrypt result `CiphertextBlob`
as the wrapped ACTIVE Branch Key.

#### Writing Branch Key and Beacon Key to Keystore

To add the branch keys and a beacon key to the keystore the
operation MUST call [Amazon DynamoDB API TransactWriteItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_TransactWriteItems.html).
The call to Amazon DynamoDB TransactWriteItems MUST use the configured Amazon DynamoDB Client to make the call.

and the `branchKeyId` from the returned `branch-key-id` field.

This operation MUST return the constructed [beacon key materials](./structures.md#beacon-key-materials).

## Encryption Context

This section describes how the AWS KMS encryption context is built
from the DynamoDB items that store the branch keys.

The following encryption context keys are shared:

- MUST have a `branch-key-id` attribute
- The `branch-key-id` field MUST not be an empty string
- MUST have a `type` attribute
- The `type` field MUST not be an empty string
- MUST have a `create-time` attribute
- MUST have a `tablename` attribute to store the logicalKeyStoreName
- MUST have a `kms-arn` attribute
- MUST have a `hierarchy-version`
- MUST NOT have a `enc` attribute

Any additionally attributes on the DynamoDB item
MUST be added to the encryption context.

### ACTIVE Encryption Context

The ACTIVE branch key is a copy of the DECRYPT_ONLY with the same `version`.
It is structured slightly differently so that the active version can be accessed quickly.

In addition to the [encryption context](#encryption-context):

The ACTIVE encryption context value of the `type` attribute MUST equal to `"branch:ACTIVE"`.
The ACTIVE encryption context MUST have a `version` attribute.
The `version` attribute MUST store the branch key version formatted like `"branch:version:"` + `version`.

### DECRYPT_ONLY Encryption Context

In addition to the [encryption context](#encryption-context):

The DECRYPT_ONLY encryption context MUST NOT have a `version` attribute.
The `type` attribute MUST stores the branch key version formatted like `"branch:version:"` + `version`.

### Beacon Key Encryption Context

In addition to the [encryption context](#encryption-context):

The Beacon key encryption context value of the `type` attribute MUST equal to `"beacon:ACTIVE"`.
The Beacon key encryption context MUST NOT have a `version` attribute.

### Custom Encryption Context

If custom [encryption context](./structures.md#encryption-context-3)
is associated with the branch key these values MUST be added to the AWS KMS encryption context.
To avoid name collisions each added attribute from the custom [encryption context](./structures.md#encryption-context-3)
MUST be prefixed with `aws-crypto-ec:`.
Across all versions of a Branch Key, the custom encryption context MUST be equal.

## AWS KMS Branch Key Decryption

The operation MUST use the configured `KMS SDK Client` to decrypt the value of the branch key field.

Every attribute except for `enc` on the AWS DDB response item
MUST be authenticated in the decryption of `enc`

Every key in the constructed [encryption context](#encryption-context)
except `tableName`
MUST exist as a string attribute in the AWS DDB response item.
Every value in the constructed [encryption context](#encryption-context)
except the logical table name
MUST equal the value with the same key in the AWS DDB response item.
The key `enc` MUST NOT exist in the constructed [encryption context](#encryption-context).

If the Keystore's [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) is `KMS Key ARN` or `KMS MRKey ARN`,
the `kms-arn` field of the DDB response item MUST be
[compatible with](#aws-key-arn-compatibility) the configured KMS Key in
the [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) for this keystore,
or the operation MUST fail.

If the Keystore's [AWS KMS Configuration](#aws-kms-configuration) is `Discovery` or `MRDiscovery`,
the `kms-arn` field of DDB response item MUST NOT be an Alias
or the operation MUST fail.

<!--  "For all Branch Keys created by any version of the MPL, an Alias for kms-arn is impossible." -->

When calling [AWS KMS Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html),
the keystore operation MUST call with a request constructed as follows:

- `KeyId`, if the KMS Configuration is Discovery, MUST be the `kms-arn` attribute value of the AWS DDB response item.
  If the KMS Configuration is MRDiscovery, `KeyId` MUST be the `kms-arn` attribute value of the AWS DDB response item, with the region replaced by the configured region.
  Otherwise, it MUST BE the Keystore's configured KMS Key.
- `CiphertextBlob` MUST be the `enc` attribute value on the AWS DDB response item
- `EncryptionContext` MUST be the [encryption context](#encryption-context) constructed above
- `GrantTokens` MUST be this keystore's [grant tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token).

## Record Format

A branch key record MUST include the following key-value pairs:

1. `branch-key-id` : Unique identifier for a branch key; represented as [AWS DDB String](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)
1. `type` : One of the following; represented as [AWS DDB String](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)
   - The string literal `"beacon:ACTIVE"`. Then `enc` is the wrapped beacon key.
   - The string `"branch:version:"` + `version`, where `version` is the Branch Key Version. Then `enc` is the wrapped branch key.
   - The string literal `"branch:ACTIVE"`. Then `enc` is the wrapped beacon key of the active version. Then
1. `version` : Only exists if `type` is the string literal `"branch:ACTIVE"`.
   Then it is the Branch Key Version. represented as [AWS DDB String](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)
1. `enc` : Encrypted version of the key;
   represented as [AWS DDB Binary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)
1. `kms-arn`: The AWS KMS Key ARN used to generate the `enc` value.
   represented as [AWS DDB String](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)
1. `create-time`: Timestamp in ISO 8601 format in UTC, to microsecond precision.
   Represented as [AWS DDB String](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)
1. `hierarchy-version`: Version of the hierarchical keyring;
   represented as [AWS DDB Number](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes)

A branch key record MAY include [custom encryption context](#custom-encryption-context) key-value pairs.
These attributes should be prefixed with `aws-crypto-ec:` the same way they are for [AWS KMS encryption context](#encryption-context).

### Branch Key Materials From Authenticated Encryption Context

The `type` attribute MUST either be equal to `"branch:ACTIVE"` or start with `"branch:version:"`.

If the `type` attribute is equal to `"branch:ACTIVE"`
then the authenticated encryption context MUST have a `version` attribute
and the version string is this value.
If the `type` attribute start with `"branch:version:"` then the version string MUST be equal to this value.

To construct [branch key materials](./structures.md#branch-key-materials) from authenticated encryption context as follows:

- [Branch Key](./structures.md#branch-key) MUST be the [decrypted branch key material](#aws-kms-branch-key-decryption)
- [Branch Key Id](./structures.md#branch-key-id) MUST be the `branch-key-id`
- [Branch Key Version](./structures.md#branch-key-version)
  The version string MUST start with `branch:version:`.
  The remaining string encoded as UTF8 bytes MUST be the Branch Key version.
- [Encryption Context](./structures.md#encryption-context-3) MUST be constructed by
  [Custom Encryption Context From Authenticated Encryption Context](#custom-encryption-context-from-authenticated-encryption-context)

### Custom Encryption Context From Authenticated Encryption Context

The custom encryption context is stored as map of UTF8 Encoded bytes.

For every key in the [encryption context](./structures.md#encryption-context-3)
the string `aws-crypto-ec:` + the UTF8 decode of this key
MUST exist as a key in the authenticated encryption context.
Also, the value in the [encryption context](./structures.md#encryption-context-3) for this key
MUST equal the value in the authenticated encryption context
for the constructed key.

### Example

Given the simplified [branch key material](./structures.md#branch-key-materials) structure

```dafny
BranchKeyMaterials(
  branchKey := [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  branchKeyId := "bbb9baf1-03e6-4716-a586-6bf29995314b",
  branchKeyVersion := "83eec007-5659-4554-bf11-699b90f41ac6",
  encryptionContext := [ "department" := "admin"]
)
```

There would be three items in the keystore table.
The DECRYPT_ONLY version, the ACTIVE version, and a beacon key.

The DECRYPT_ONLY simplified JavaScript JSON format would look like this

```json
{
  "branch-key-id": "bbb9baf1-03e6-4716-a586-6bf29995314b",
  "type": "branch:version:83eec007-5659-4554-bf11-699b90f41ac6",

  "hierarchy-version": "1",
  "aws-crypto-ec:department": "admin"
}
```

The ACTIVE simplified JavaScript JSON format would look like this

```json

  "create-time" : "2023-06-03T19:03:29.358Z",
  "hierarchy-version" : "1",
  "aws-crypto-ec:department" : "admin",
}
```

The BEACON simplified JavaScript JSON format would look like this

```json
{
  "branch-key-id": "bbb9baf1-03e6-4716-a586-6bf29995314b",
  "type": "beacon:ACTIVE",
  "enc": "hgb2RyDQinOCpzKWdi17E+t9WB9pRExQXpD/20bsu9hxr38HjQvGvihoYpL6sKuF0Ek+37B1UE9tK3SIOiE=",
  "kms-arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
  "create-time": "2023-06-03T19:03:29.358Z",
  "hierarchy-version": "1",
  "aws-crypto-ec:department": "admin"
}
```
