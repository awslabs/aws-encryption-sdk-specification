2.4.  Overview

   A keyring which combines other keyrings, allowing one Section 2.7.1
   or Section 2.7.2 call to modify the encryption
   (structures.md#encryption-materials) or decryption
   (structures.md#decryption-materials) materials using more than one
   keyring.

   A multi-keyring is capable of producing encrypted data keys that can
   be decrypted by multiple keyrings.  A multi-keyring can decrypt an
   encrypted data key as long as the multi-keyring contains at least one
   keyring capable of decrypting that encrypted data key.

2.5.  Definitions

2.5.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

2.6.  Inputs

   On keyring initialization, a keyring MUST define at least one of the
   following:

   *  Generator Keyring (Section 2.6.1)

   *  Child Keyrings (Section 2.6.2)

2.6.1.  Generator Keyring

   A keyring (keyring-interface.md) that can generate data keys
   (keyring-interface.md#generate-data-key).

   This keyring MUST implement the Generate Data Key (keyring-
   interface.md#generate-data-key) behavior during OnEncrypt (keyring-
   interface.md#onencrypt).  This means that this keyring MUST return
   encryption materials (structures.md#encryption-materials) containing
   a plaintext data key on OnEncrypt (keyring-interface.md#onencrypt).

   If the list of child keyrings (Section 2.6.2) is empty, a generator
   keyring (Section 2.6.1) MUST be defined for the keyring.

2.6.2.  Child Keyrings

   A list of keyrings (keyring-interface.md) to be used to modify the
   encryption (structures.md#encryption-materials) or decryption
   materials (structures.md#decryption-materials).

   If this keyring does not have a generator keyring (Section 2.6.1),
   this list MUST NOT be empty.

2.7.  Operation

2.7.1.  OnEncrypt

   If this keyring has a generator keyring, this keyring MUST first
   generate a plaintext data key using the generator keyring:

   *  If the input encryption materials already include a plaintext data
      key, OnEncrypt MUST fail.

   *  This keyring MUST first call the generator keyring's OnEncrypt
      using the input encryption materials as input.

   *  If the generator keyring fails OnEncrypt, this OnEncrypt MUST also
      fail.

   *  If the generator keyring returns encryption materials missing a
      plaintext data key, OnEncrypt MUST fail.

   If this keyring does not have a generator keyring (Section 2.6.1),
   and the input encryption materials (structures.md#encryption-
   materials) does not include a plaintext data key, OnEncrypt MUST
   fail.

   Next, for each keyring (keyring-interface.md) in this keyring's list
   of child keyrings (Section 2.6.2), the keyring MUST call OnEncrypt
   (keyring-interface.md#onencrypt).  The encryption materials
   (structures.md#encryption-materials) input into OnEncrypt are the
   input encryption materials if this is the first OnEncrypt call.  If
   this is not the first OnEncrypt call, the encryption materials input
   into OnEncrypt are the encryption materials output by the previous
   OnEncrypt call.  If the child keyring's OnEncrypt (keyring-
   interface.md#onencrypt) fails, this OnEncrypt MUST also fail.

   If all previous OnEncrypt (keyring-interface.md#onencrypt) calls
   succeeded, this keyring MUST return the encryption materials
   (structures.md#encryption-materials) returned by the last OnEncrypt
   call.

2.7.2.  OnDecrypt

   If the decryption materials already contain a plaintext data key, the
   keyring MUST fail and MUST NOT modify the decryption materials
   (structures.md#decryption-materials).

   Otherwise, OnDecrypt MUST attempt to decrypt the encrypted data keys
   (structures.md#encrypted-data-keys-1) in the input decryption
   materials (structures.md#decryption-materials) using its child
   keyrings (Section 2.6.2) and, if it is specified, its generator
   keyring (Section 2.6.1).  It MUST attempt to decrypt using these
   keyrings until it either succeeds in decryption, or it has attempted
   to decrypt using all its child keyrings and, if it is specified, its
   generator keyring.  If a generator keyring is specified, it MUST be
   used first.

   For each keyring (keyring-interface.md) to be used for decryption,
   the multi-keyring MUST call that keyring's OnDecrypt (keyring-
   interface.md#ondecrypt) using the unmodified decryption materials
   (structures.md#decryption-materials) and the input encrypted data key
   (structures.md#encrypted-data-key) list.  If OnDecrypt (keyring-
   interface.md#ondecrypt) returns decryption materials
   (structures.md#decryption-materials) containing a plaintext data key,
   the keyring MUST immediately return the modified decryption
   materials.

   If, after calling OnDecrypt (keyring-interface.md#ondecrypt) on every
   child keyring (Section 2.6.2) (and possibly the generator keyring
   (Section 2.6.1)), the decryption materials (structures.md#decryption-
   materials) still do not contain a plaintext data key:

   *  If none of the above OnDecrypt (keyring-interface.md#ondecrypt)
      calls failed, the keyring MUST return the unmodified decryption
      materials (structures.md#decryption-materials).

   *  If at least one of the above OnDecrypt (keyring-
      interface.md#ondecrypt) calls failed, OnDecrypt MUST also fail,
      and MUST not modify the input decryption materials
      (structures.md#decryption-materials).

2.8.  Security Considerations

   Users SHOULD examine the keyrings (keyring-interface.md) they include
   in a multi-keyring to ensure that they understand what set of
   keyrings will be capable of obtaining the plaintext data key from the
   returned set of encrypted data keys.

   In more detail:

   Multi-keyrings will produce a set of encrypted data keys
   (structures.md#encrypted-data-key) on OnEncrypt (keyring-
   interface.md#onencrypt) that includes the encrypted data keys of
   every sub-keyring (a keyring which is either the generator keyring
   (Section 2.6.1) or a member of child keyrings (Section 2.6.2)) that
   is capable of producing encrypted data keys.

   As such, any keyring (keyring-interface.md) that is capable of
   obtaining the plaintext data key from encrypted data keys
   (structures.md#encrypted-data-key) produced by one of the sub-
   keyrings, by definition, is capable of obtaining the plaintext data
   key for the set of encrypted data keys the multi-keyring produces on
   OnEncrypt (keyring-interface.md#onencrypt).

   In typical cases, most keyrings (keyring-interface.md) are defined
   such that they are capable of decrypting the encrypted data keys they
   produce.  As such, when including such keyrings (keyring-
   interface.md), the multi-keyring will produce a set of encrypted data
   keys (structures.md#encrypted-data-keys) such that any one of the
   sub-keyrings is capable of obtaining the plaintext data key.
